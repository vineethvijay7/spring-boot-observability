            ### ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your Pull Request!
            
            #### Please ensure that:
            - [ ] You have ran the tests locally before your commits !! This will help to avoid surprises later along the road..

            #### :radio_button: Add following label to your PR to make changes in the tests execution.
                  Check right side of this PR screen to find `Labels` section:

            - Label: `run-fast`: Runs only the build, no tests! This is added as default. You can change this behaviour by adding more labels mentioned below.
            - Label: `run-tests`: Run Tests too. You may only need to add this when you really want it. Ideally when you are ready to merge.

            Obviously, `run-tests` and `run-fast` are mutually exclusive. You can only have one of them at a time. This will be taken care automatically.

            **NOTE** that you cannot merge PRs without running all your tests with the last committed changes!
