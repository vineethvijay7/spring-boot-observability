            ### ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your Pull Request!
            
            **Please ensure that:**
            - [ ] You have ran the tests locally before your commits!
                  This will help to avoid surprises later along the road.

            #### :radio_button: Add following label to your PR to make changes in the tests execution:

            - `run-fast`: Runs only the build, no tests! This is added as default. You can change this behaviour by adding more labels mentioned below.
            - `run-tests`: Run Tests. You only need to add this when you want it, ideally right before merge, preferably after PR reviews and all.


            **NOTE** that you cannot merge the PR without running the tests with the last committed changes!
