            ### ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your Pull Request!

            #### :radio_button: Add the following label to your PR to make changes in the build workflow execution:

            - `run-fast`: Runs only the build, no tests. This is default. You can change this behaviour by adding the labels mentioned below.
            - `run-tests`: Run Tests. You only need to add this when it is really ready to merge, preferably after PR reviews and all.

            **Please ensure that:**
            - [ ] You have ran the tests locally before your each commits.
                  This will help to avoid surprises when you add the label `run-tests` and notice test failures.
